# Roboflow Model library

## Overview


The Roboflow Model Library contains pre-configured model architectures for easily training a computer vision model.

The below repositories contain a link to Jupyter Notebook that requires minimal changes to work with data you export from Roboflow - often times, you only need to replace one line of code with a link to your own account's data, and the rest of the notebook runs.

Any of the below notebooks can be run on Google Colab.
